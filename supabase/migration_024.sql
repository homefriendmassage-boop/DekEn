-- 1) Free viewers: how many clear faces per category per day.
--      * nobody bought a rank in the category  -> 6, drawn by the daily shuffle (new set every midnight, Thailand time)
--      * providers bought a rank (or are admin-pinned) -> THEY take the clear-face places first (block A, B, C, then
--        by purchase time) and the daily shuffle only fills what is left up to 6;
--        with more than 6 bought ranks the number grows with them, never above 10.
-- 2) Agency logo upload: re-uploading (upsert) a file needs a SELECT policy as well as INSERT/UPDATE; without it the
--    upload fails with a row-level-security error. The bucket is public, so reading is allowed for everyone anyway.
